**What is this?**

Thirty small webapps I made for Wes Bos's challenge [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

**What did I learn?**

- Some obscure ES6 sugar
- Many browser APIs
- Local storage
- The arcane art of finishing projects

**How was the course?**

As someone who has too much unfinished stuff, finishing that many small projects in one month it's wonderful :)

**Additional info**

In my free time I like to take courses and, since 2019, I've been trying to write them down and give them a rating. You can see it [here](https://github.com/abrahammenendez/courses/).
