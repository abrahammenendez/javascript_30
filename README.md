**What is this?**

Thirty (yes, thirty) small webapps I made for Wes Bos' challenge [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

**What did I learn?**

- Some obscure ES6 sugar
- Many browser APIs
- Local storage
- The arcane art of finishing projects

**How was the course?**

As someone who has too much unfinished stuff, finishing that many small projects in one month it's wonderful :)

**Additional info**

For the past six years I've taken a lot of courses in my free time. Sadly, I never thought about compiling them into a list. Since 2019, I've been trying to write down (and rate) every new course I take. You can see it [here](https://github.com/abrahammenendez/courses/).
