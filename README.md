**What is this?**

Thirty small webapps I made for Wes Bos' challenge [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/).

**What did I learn?**

- Some obscure ES6 sugar
- Many browser APIs
- Local storage
- The arcane art of finishing projects

**How was the challenge?**

As someone who has too much unfinished stuff, finishing that many small projects in one month it's wonderful :)
